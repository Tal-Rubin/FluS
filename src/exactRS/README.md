This folder contains an exact Reimann solver for the Euler equations.

## Ers library

The files `ers.h` and `ers.cpp` are used by other parts of `FluS`. They are used there to determine the Godunov flux between adjacent elements, by exactly solving the Riemann_problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_problem) for the Euler equations.

## Solution sampling and plotting

The `testErs` executable, compiled from `testErs.cpp` and `ers.cpp` would be used to sample the solution generated by the Ers library. It contains 5 pre-set initial conditions, used in the litarture as hard-to-numerically-approximate examples (at least when using finite volume methods). These examples are accessible by running the executable with an integer 0-4 as a command line argument.

Alternatively, one can supply 11 floating points for density, 3-velocity and pressure for right and left states, and time.

The Python wrapper `ersWrap.py` should be run from the `FluS/build` directory, and contain pre-set parameters for the `testErs` executable, in addition to saving the output to a text file, reading it to Numpy, and plotting in Matplotlib.
