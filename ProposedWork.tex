\section{Proposed work}

We propose to build a code capable of handling different fluid models, and different solvers.

The code would be split into three computational steps: 
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pre-processor: \newline
Meshing, Initial conditions.

\item Solver: \newline
Time-stepping, Boundary conditions.

\item Post-processor: \newline
Visualization.

\end{enumerate}

The code could be written to be extensible from 1 to higher dimensionality.

It is likely we would attempt to use an external library for the pre-processor (such as \textit{MFEM}, or others).
We might want to have a choice between ``regular" time-stepping algorithms such as Runge-Kutta or Adams-Moulton, and symplectic algorithms such as leap-frog.

The fluid model must be written such that it fits a symplectic time-stepper.
